                    Yes, you have to check the notification box below the note and enter your email address. Privnote will send 
                    an email to that address when the note is read. You can also add a reference to identify each note.

                    Right. But, then again, you couldn't prevent the recipient from taking a screen capture or even memorizing the note. 
                    That's why Privnote doesn't try to protect the note contents from being copied. It only makes sure that the contents 
                    is never read, by anyone, before it reaches the recipient, and is never read by anyone afterward either. 
                    What the recipient does with the note is his sole responsability.

                  At Privnote, privacy is taken very seriously, since the main purpose of the site is to preserve it. 
                  This policy outlines the measures taken by Privnote to protect the privacy of its users.
                </p>
                
                <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mt-6 mb-3">1. Service description</h3>
                <p>
                  Privnote is a free web based service that allows users to create encrypted notes that they can share over 
                  the internet as unique one-time-use HTTPS URLs (hereafter referred to as links) which by default expire 
                  after its first access via any web browser.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As Privnote does not provide any means for transmitting the link, the act of sending the link is the full 
                  responsibility of Privnote users.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Depending on the communication channel of your choice (e.g., e-mail, fax, SMS, phone, instant messaging, 
                  social media), there may be a certain risk that third parties intercept your communication, get knowledge 
                  of the communicated link and thus may be able to read your note.
                </p>
                
                <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mt-6 mb-3">2. How the notes and its contents are processed</h3>
                <p>
                  The link is generated in the user's browser and at no time is sent as such to Privnote. The link is thus 
                  in the sender's (and later possibly in the recipient's) hands only. Therefore, there is no way to recover 
                  a note if a Privnote user losses the link.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since only the link binds the decryption key to the note's content and since Privnote does not have the link, 
                  at no time is any note held in any readable format state at Privnote. This assures that nobody (including 
                  Privnote's administrators) can read a note.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When using Privnote's default funtionality, when a note is retrieved, its data is completely removed from 
                  Privnote; there is absolutely no way to recover it again.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When "Show options" is selected and the user opts for a time interval for the note's removal, then independently 
                  of how many times the note is retrieved, the note will be deleted only after that specified time is completed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After a note is deleted from Privnote, there is absolutely no way to recover it again.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When a note is not retrieved after 30 days, Privnote removes it permanently, just as if it were read.The Privnote 
                  sysadmin team will do as much as possible to protect the site against unauthorized access, modification or 
                  destruction of the data. But, even if someone or something could manage to gain access to the database, they 
                  would be unable to read the notes since their contents are encrypted and can't be decrypted without the links 
                  which Privnote never has a hold of.
                </p>
                
                <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mt-6 mb-3">3. Processing of IP addresses</h3>
                <p>
                  Privnote is not logging the IP addresses; they are processed to enable communication with Privnote's servers 
                  but they are not part of the log-files. IP addresses are deleted as soon as they are no longer needed for the 
                  purpose of communication.
                </p>
                
                <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mt-6 mb-3">4. Pseudonymous data</h3>
                <p>
                  The creator of the note can introduce personal data into the note. Even though this data is encrypted, the 
                  data can be decrypted again and thus constitutes pseudonymous (personal) data. In any case, one cannot deduce 
                  the note's creator from Privnote's database, as Privnote does not store IP addresses.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The decryption of the note's data is in the users' hands (sender and recipient). Privnote is not able to decrypt 
                  the note and access the data (personal or otherwise) introduced by the creator since Privnote is never in 
                  possession of the decryption key which is contained only in the link.
                </p>
                
                <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mt-6 mb-3">5. Disclaimer</h3>
                <p>
                  When a person clicks the Privnote's link, Privnote declines any responsibility related to the note's content.
                </p>
                
                <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mt-6 mb-3">6. Disclosure of Data to Third Party</h3>
                <p>
                  Privnote does not share nor sell any information to others, nor use it in any way not mentioned in this 
                  Privacy Policy.
                </p>

                  Have you ever wanted to send confidential information within your work environment, to family or friends, 
                  but were afraid to do so over the internet, because some malicious hacker could be spying on you?

                  Privnote is a free web based service that allows you to send top secret notes over the internet. 
                  It's fast, easy, and requires no password or user registration at all.

                  Just write your note, and you'll get a link. Then you copy and paste that link into an email (or instant message) 
                  that you send to the person who you want to read the note. When that person clicks the link for the first time, 
                  they will see the note in their browser and the note will automatically self-destruct; which means no one 
                  (even that very same person) can read the note again. The link won't work anymore.
